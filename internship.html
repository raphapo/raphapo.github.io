        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Professional Development</h3>
        <p>This intensive 5-day internship at Atelier Thierry Roche & Associés provided invaluable insights into how a real architecture office operates, from collaborative design processes to project management workflows. During this internship I learned how to use a new software, Lumion, which facilitated the task of visualization. I witnessed firsthand how theoretical concepts translate into practical, client-focused solutions and gained a comprehensive understanding of contemporary architectural practice.</p>
        <h3>Personal Growth</h3>
        <p>On a personal level, I developed essential interpersonal skills through working alongside experienced architects, learning the importance of clear communication and teamwork in creative environments. While I regret not having the opportunity to visit an active construction site, this experience has solidified my commitment to pursuing architecture as a career and established a strong foundation for my continued development in the field.</p>
