      <h2>My Journey in Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Raphael, a high school student at Redwood High School with a passion for architecture and design. I am fascinated by how thoughtful spaces can improve people's lives and inspire creativity. Through my studies and personal projects, I am exploring the fundamentals of architecture, from sustainable design to innovative structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio showcases some of my favorite projects and concepts. As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited to take on new challenges and develop my skills further. My goal is to pursue architecture in higher education and eventually contribute to creating spaces that are both functional and inspiring.
      </p>

        Thank you for visiting my portfolio and supporting my journey!
